I started pair-programming with [Daniel Szmulewicz][danielszmu] to
increase my proficiency with [emacs][]. Although I have a working
knowledge of emacs I need a mentor to show me the ropes.

I took the decision to start out from scratch so I can better
understand what decision you are able to make to customize emacs. And
what better starting point then building emacs from source.

The [emacs wiki][wiki] has a section on various [ports][] of
emacs. You can find instructions how to obtain or build emacs for
various platforms.

I am not copying the instructions from the wiki. They worked for
my without a lot of problems. If you have problems with it drop me a
line.
