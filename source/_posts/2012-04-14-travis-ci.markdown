A few months ago I came across
[Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/ "Continous Integration Landing Page on Travis CI").

Travis CI describes itself as

> A hosted continuous integration service for the open source
>  community.

It integrates with
[GitHub](https://github.com/ "Social Coding with git") via 
[post-receive hooks](http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/ "GitHub on Post-Receive Hooks").
So everytime you push to your GitHub repository Travis gets notified
and will start building and testing your code.

You have to provide a
[.travis.yml](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/ "Travis CI on build configuration")
to configure your build. Although you could customize your build in
enormous detail, the defaults provided by Travis CI allow you to start
using continous integration easily.

The bare minimum for a `.travis.yml` file is the language keyword. For
example, the file below will instruct Travis to build a java project
using maven, gradle or ant depending on which files are
present. I.e. a `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` or `build.xml` file.

``` yaml Minimal .travis.yml file for a Java project http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/languages/java/ Travis CI documentation
language: java
```

Travis CI supports numerous languages, including Java, Ruby, Erlang,
Clojure and Haskell. The lanuguage list is growing. To a look on the
[documentation page](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/ "Travis CI documentation page")
for an up-to-date list.

So consider Travis CI for all your open source build.
