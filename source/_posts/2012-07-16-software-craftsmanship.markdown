Software Craftmanship is a 
[hot topic](http://www.google.com/trends/?q=craftsmanship&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all "Google Trend for Craftmanship").
Like all fancy terms it is subject to inflation. What does 
[Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/ "Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship")
mean when different people use it?

[Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/ "Homepage of Martin Fowler")
retreaded an article about
[Semantic Diffusion](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html "Martin Fowler on Semantic Diffusion")
which addresses this point. In this blog post I try to expose the
values of Software Craftsmanship I held dear.

### It is a Journey

The metaphor used by the software crafsmanship movement is that of a
[guild](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild "Wikipedia on Guild").

> A guild (German: Gilde) is an association of craftsmen in a
> particular trade. The earliest types of guild were formed as
> confraternities of workers.

Before an apprentice could become a true master she would have to work
as a
[journeyman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman "Wikipedia on Journeyman").
Learning the tricks of the trade while travelling from master to
master.

For my, This journey symbolises that software craftsman continously
improves her skills. Furthermore she should sieze every oppertunity to
learn the "secrets" of the craft.

This implies having an open mind, accept critisims and  be inquisitive.

### Become a Giant

Famous scientist 
[Isaac Newton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Wikipedia on Isaac Newton")
is purported to have said to 
"[stand on the shoulders of giants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants "Wikipedia on the famous quote and its origin")".
I certainly remember that I gained a lot with the aid of others. In
this modern day of age one can learn a vast amount of skills, opinions
and trivia via books, forums, blogs, podcasts and social media.

I would look to take to oppertunity to give back to the same community
that trained my to become the software craftsman I am today. I do this
by playing an active rather than a passive role in the commity. I
aspire to give talks about various subjects. I answer questions in
forums, I patch bugs in software, create open source projects and I
maintain a humble blog. 

In my opinion a software craftsman should look out for her fellow guildmembers.
