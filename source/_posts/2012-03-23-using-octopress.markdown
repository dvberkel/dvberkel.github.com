Today I started using 
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Homepage of Octopress"). The
description of Octopress as found on the homepage is

> Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the
> blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start
> blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates,
> CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Octopress
> All of that is already taken care of. Simply clone or fork
> Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and youâ€™re set.

Right of the bat you have a fully customizable generated blog when you
follow the getting started [guide](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/ "Octopress Setup").
I used the GitHub pages 
[deployment option](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/ "Octopress on GitHub pages deployement")
and it worked like a charm.

But a word of warning is necessary. The Octopress' subtitle *A blogging
framework for hackers* is in place. You should be comfortable working
your way around the commandline before using Octopress.

As [uncle Ben](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3602 "Wikipedia on the fictional character 'Uncle Ben'") 
has taught us "With great power comes great responsibility", the
enourmous flexibillity of Octopress comes at a price. Although the
defaults of Octopress are fine, you should invest the time to finetune
your own blog.

So you can expect the blog to changes it's appearance while I settle
on some design choices.
