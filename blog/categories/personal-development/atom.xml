<a href="http://www.google.com/trends/?q=craftsmanship&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all" title="Google Trend for Craftmanship">hot topic</a>.
Like all fancy terms it is subject to inflation. What does
<a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/" title="Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship">Software Craftsmanship</a>
mean when different people use it?</p>

<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/" title="Homepage of Martin Fowler">Martin Fowler</a>
retreaded an article about
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html" title="Martin Fowler on Semantic Diffusion">Semantic Diffusion</a>
which addresses this point. In this blog post I try to expose the
values of Software Craftsmanship I held dear.</p>

<h3>It is a Journey</h3>

<p>The metaphor used by the software crafsmanship movement is that of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild" title="Wikipedia on Guild">guild</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A guild (German: Gilde) is an association of craftsmen in a
particular trade. The earliest types of guild were formed as
confraternities of workers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Before an apprentice could become a true master she would have to work
as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman" title="Wikipedia on Journeyman">journeyman</a>.
Learning the tricks of the trade while travelling from master to
master.</p>

<p>For my, This journey symbolises that software craftsman continously
improves her skills. Furthermore she should sieze every oppertunity to
learn the "secrets" of the craft.</p>

<p>This implies having an open mind, accept critisims and  be inquisitive.</p>

<h3>Become a Giant</h3>

<p>Famous scientist
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" title="Wikipedia on Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>
is purported to have said to
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants" title="Wikipedia on the famous quote and its origin">stand on the shoulders of giants</a>".
I certainly remember that I gained a lot with the aid of others. In
this modern day of age one can learn a vast amount of skills, opinions
and trivia via books, forums, blogs, podcasts and social media.</p>

<p>I would look to take to oppertunity to give back to the same community
that trained my to become the software craftsman I am today. I do this
by playing an active rather than a passive role in the commity. I
aspire to give talks about various subjects. I answer questions in
forums, I patch bugs in software, create open source projects and I
maintain a humble blog.</p>

<p>In my opinion a software craftsman should look out for her fellow guildmembers.</p>
